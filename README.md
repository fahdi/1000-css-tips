<summary>Tip 1: Embrace the Box Model for Effective Layouts</summary>
Understanding the CSS box model is crucial for arranging layout elements. It consists of four parts:

1. **Content**: The actual content of the box, where text and images appear.
2. **Padding**: Space between the content and the border.
3. **Border**: Encloses the padding and content.
4. **Margin**: Space between the border and other elements.

Here's a basic example:

```css
.box {
  width: 300px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  margin: 15px;
}
```

This CSS will create a box of width 300px, with a padding of 10px around the content. It has a 5px solid black border and is spaced 15px away from other elements. By adjusting these properties, you can control the layout and spacing of elements on your webpage.
